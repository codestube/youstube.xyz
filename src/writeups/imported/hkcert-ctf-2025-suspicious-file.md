## Write up:
We were given [a file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/HKCERT%20CTF%202025/Suspicious%20File/files/SuspiciousFile) with 1 line of encoded blob. It looked a lot like base64-encoded text.  
![blob](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/HKCERT%20CTF%202025/Suspicious%20File/media/blob.png)  
So undoubtedly, I went to decode it in [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false))... wait what? is that not Base64?  
It looked REALLY like a base64 though.. unless... it's something **a bit** lower  
![decode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/HKCERT%20CTF%202025/Suspicious%20File/media/decode.png)  
I got it! It's base58, now I know this still looks like non-sense, but reading some of the words like `ftypavis` and `avifavis...` gave me a clue that this is an .avif file, an AV1 Image File.  
And downloading it looks like this...  
![sus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/HKCERT%20CTF%202025/Suspicious%20File/files/sus.avif)  
Cool image I'd say, with reference to one of Hong Kong's biggest supermarket chain [Wellcome](https://www.wellcome.com.hk/) as well! <sub/>(this is a joke)  
## My understanding:
After getting this, I just assumed this to be a normal image steg, but I wasn't familiar with .avif image steg. So firstly I ran to ChatGPT and ask if there's anything special in this image. It gave me the last part from decode the stts msb table, and getting `last part: Future_0f_Im4ge_F0rm4t}`. So I assume for the first part must also be somehow related. <strong> OH BOY I HOPE I DIDN'T TUNNEL VISION </strong> <sub> totally not subtle foreshadowing...</sub>
## Our Solution:
So I spend quite a while understanding .avif file structure and seeing where else could we possibly find lsb / msb to find the first part. Laggy then joined in and asked my progress, and I showed him what we had. I kid you not, bro found it in 10 minutes, from using [this website](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/) that it's common for image steg...

## Conclusion:
~~dont get tunnel visioned~~ Things could always be easier than what you think :> and I didn't know .avif doesn't work with stegsolve.jar :sob:
## Shoutout:
- Laggy (My teammate)
- HKCERT (Organizer)
- ChatGPT (for giving me the solve script)
