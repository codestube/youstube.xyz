## Write up:
When I first open this excel spreadsheet, I see <b>stonks</b>. <sub>ba dum tss</sub>  
![dashboard-ui](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/PolyUCTF%202025/Business%20Intelligence/media/dashboard-1.png)  
I looked around the spreadsheet, moving pictures, saw these fake flags, some of which were kinda fun.  
![data-ui](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/PolyUCTF%202025/Business%20Intelligence/media/data.png)
* PUCTF25{ch4tgpt_c0mpet1t0r}
* PUCTF25{d33p_s33k_w4s_h3r3}
* PUCTF25{bruteforce_me_daddy}PUCTF25{THIS_IS_A_FAKE_FLAG} << this is just weird..

Lastly, looked at the **aux** sheet. Nothing much here.  
![aux-ui](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/PolyUCTF%202025/Business%20Intelligence/media/aux-1.png)  

However, I wanted to go back on the button in the Dashboard page, and see what does it do.  
![unable-to-run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/PolyUCTF%202025/Business%20Intelligence/media/unable%20to%20run.png)  
Hmm, that's definitely weird..  
So I actually went out my way and enabling VBA macros in my excel, just so I can get to the bottom of it

![DONT-DO-THIS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/PolyUCTF%202025/Business%20Intelligence/media/DONT%20DO%20THIS.png)  
> DISCLAIMER: DO NOT ENABLE THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW THE FILE IS ABSOLUTELY SAFE.

However, Excel still blocked my action. So I REALLY wanted to know what this macro really does.  
I right clicked Dashboard &rarr; View Code..  
![password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/PolyUCTF%202025/Business%20Intelligence/media/password.png)  
A password? Of all places you could've put one, it is in the one blocking the macro script?  
Looks like it's something important <sub>heheh- *cough*</sub>

## My Solution:
Since the VBAProject is locked behind password, we can:
1. Look for password inside the Excel Spreadsheet, or;
2. Just remove the password /shrug

So, I googled for a script / tool to remove VBA's password. and [this came up.](https://trumpexcel.com/excel-vba/remove-password/)

> Disclaimer: Do not run random script from the internet if you don't know what it does.

This script basically listens for the prompt of password when trying to open chal.xlsm's VBAProject. When Office pop up a password dialog `DialogBoxParamA`, it hooks the function, intercept the request and return 1 (which means success), cracking open the VBAProject.  
  
So I opened a new Excel spreadsheet (Ctrl + N) &rarr; Went to view code &rarr; Inserted a new module &rarr; Pasted this code &rarr; Run it, and voila!

And now, we have the code for the macro!

Well, hello. You. <sub>(Sorry I was watching the new season of You on netflix.) </sub> <br>

```
connectionString = "ODBC;DRIVER=SQL Server;SERVER=chal.polyuctf.com,51337;DATABASE=NuttyERP;UID=Nutty_Executive;PWD=NuttExec03172025;"
```
Looks like we hit the jackpot. Now all we have to do is to access this SQL database server locally.  
I'll be using Azure Data Studio, but feel free to use any Database Management Tool you'd prefer.  
I'll click on `New connection`, select `SQL Login` and input the details given from the code line.  
![connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/PolyUCTF%202025/Business%20Intelligence/media/connection.png)  
Now when we connect, we should see 5 tables, with 1 of it being special. `secret`  
![tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/PolyUCTF%202025/Business%20Intelligence/media/tables.png) 
So, we'll just make a simple SQL query,  
`select * from secret`  
Ladies and gentlemen, we got 'em.  
![flag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codestube/CTF-Write-Ups/main/PolyUCTF%202025/Business%20Intelligence/media/flag.png)  
The flag is `PUCTF25{H4rD_C0d3D_CR3d3Nt14l5_Mu5T_h4v3_B33n_Th3_1Nt3rN_f8060c2a1d041f414eff8a60a5db1846}`
## Conclusion
This was really fun to say the least, realizing that VBA module can be so easily broken into with a script to copy and paste made me more aware that many things are simply a google search away, and I'm glad that all my time learning SQL query didn't go to waste after all. This was also my very first >300 solve on not just this CTF, but on my first ever CTF participated. So I'm really glad that I actually got the flag and happy that I can solve puzzles from online CTFs. A huge confidence boost to say the least. :>
